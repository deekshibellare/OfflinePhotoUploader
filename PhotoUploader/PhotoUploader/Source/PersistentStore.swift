/// Persistence Store handles offline support for the jobs. A Job is image upload task which will consist of a reference to the image, current state of the task, the timestamp on which it is added etc. This class stores jobs in memory, as well as in document directory.

It provides methods to enqueue the job and fetch next job, delete the job and other convenience methods
